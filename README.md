## 🚀 About The Project
Welcome to my algorithmic laboratory! I am a final-year **Industrial Engineering** student passionate about bridging the gap between **Operations Research** and **Software Engineering**.

In this repository, I build, analyze, and visualize popular **Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithms** from scratch (without relying on black-box optimization libraries). My goal is to understand the mathematical intuition behind these algorithms and apply them to complex engineering problems such as:
* Production Planning
* Supply Chain Optimization
* Scheduling Problems
* System Simulation
